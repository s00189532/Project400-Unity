GOAP TUTORIAL VIDEO LINK

create graphs/visual representations of behaviour trees and GOAP structures  maded for the project

need to finish implementation AI code outside GOAP scripts to make use of GOAP scripts

if multiple actions satisfy goal cost decides which is used

change actions code to have system.type arrays instead of lsits if he doesnt change to lists in the video

potentially clean up component screen on AI by creating scripts to manage addition of goals and actions so they are not
added to the character individually as seperate scripts.

as more actions and goals are made the planner does more calculations and performance will technically weaken
but performance hit will still probably be very small

GOAP planner from tutorial is added to every AI instead of being global

tutorial uses monolithic approach where each goal is completed by one action instead of the microlithic approach
where a goal can be completed by one or a set of actions such e.g(attack target goal = detect -> moveto -> attack)

might need to add namespaces to GOAP and Behaviour Trees to seperate them and clean up code

at 45mins used custom ai script  to add values to blackboard.
need to add once AI is made.
-Node_Base
-BehaviourTree


null reference error appears looking for tree object in behaviour tree editor when editor is open but tree is not selected.
(doesnt break anything just complains about tree not being visible until i select a tree to display)
